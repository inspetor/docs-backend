## Authentication Activity
```shell
curl -X POST https://collection-prod.inspcdn.net/auth \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
    -d '{
        "user_id":     "232550",
        "action_type": "login_failure"
    }'
```

Account login/logout behavior is highly correlated with fraudulent activity. You can send information about successful or failed login attempts for an account (as well as logouts) via the `/auth` endpoint, which supports `POST` requests only.

The following fields are required:

Property    | Type   | Description
--------    | ----   | -----------
user_id     | String | The user ID that was (or was attempted to be) logged into
action_type | String | What type of authentication activity occurred. Accepted values are limited to `'login_failure'`, `'login_success'`, and `'logout'` (case-insensitive).
