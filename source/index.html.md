# Introduction

Inspetor is a product developed to protect your company from losses due to fraud and chargebacks, all while maximizing revenue from valid purchases and maintaining the simple payment flow that your customers love.

# Installing the Client Library


```php
~ composer require inspetor/inspetor-php:${version}
```

The Inspetor collection libraries are avaible via public standard package managers for the following supported languages:

- PHP (via <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/inspetor/inspetor-php">Composer</a>)


# Client Library Setup

```php
<?php

use Inspetor;

$inspetor_config = [
  "appId"       => [your appId] (e.g. company.api),
  "trackerName" => [your trackerName] (e.g. 30cdfed3-9f7f-4aaa-b9f1-033c4dbfef58)
];

$inspetor = new InspetorClient($inspetor_config);

?>
```

The first step of integrating Inspetor's antifraud services into your product is instantiating the library.

In order to do so, you will need to pass the `InspetorClient` your product's **App ID** and **Tracker Name**, both of which will be provided to you by the Inspetor Team.

_Et voil√†_! You now have an Inspetor client object that is capable of sending all of the information necessary to teach Inspetor's decision layer how to prevent fraud at your company. However, there is obviously a difference between instantiating a client instance and using it properly.

# Using the Client Library

Inspetor prevents chargebacks due to fraudulent purposes. In order to protect your company from fraudsters, our decision models need to be informed with customer behavior.

Events like logins, profile updates, or even unrelated purchases on the same account all contribute to our assessment of whether or not a given transaction might be fraudulent. But we can't do it alone--we need _you_, our client, to send this information to us via the Client Library so that we can make better-informed decisions.

At a high level, our decision model understands the e-commerce world in the following primary terms:

- <a href="#account">**Accounts**</a>
- <a href="#event">**Events**</a>
- <a href="#sale">**Sales**</a>
- <a href="#item">**Sale Items**</a>
- <a href="#transfer">**Transfers**</a>

You can think of the relationship between those entities something like this: If a user purchases tickets for a show on your site, Inspetor interprets the action as:

- the creation of a new <a href="#sale">*Sale*</a>
- the association of that Sale with an existing <a href="#account">*Account*</a>
- the association of that Sale with an <a href="#item">*Item*</a>
- the association of that Item with an existing <a href="#item">*Event*</a>

## When to send events to Inspetor

The primary Inspetor entities are **stateful** objects. They have properites that can be updated, and the values of these properties are crucial to our evaluation of transaction validity. However, if we base our evaluation upon outdated or incorrected information, the accuracy of our evaluation is likely to suffer as well. As such, it is critical that you notify Inspetor of any changes to these properties whenever they occur via the Inspetor Client Library.

<aside class="notice">
Inspetor will never request access to your code base--that means that it is on <i>you</i>, the developer, to integrate our library into your product's code base. We think that's the right way to do things: you know your product's code base, we know fraud.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
It is however <b>extremely important</b> that you provide us with updated information at any stage that these primary entities are updated. If we are working with outdated or incorrect information, we can't make reliable predictions for you.
</aside>

The Inspetor Client Library provides methods for you to relay state changes to primary entities in any of the following instances:

### Account
- When an account is <a href="#tracking-account-creation">created</a>
- When an account is <a href="#tracking-account-updates">updated</a>
- When an account is <a href="#tracking-account-deletion">deleted</a>

### Event
- When an event is <a href="#tracking-event-creation">created</a>
- When an event is <a href="#tracking-event-updates">updated</a>
- When an event is <a href="#tracking-event-deletion">deleted</a>

### Transfer
- When a request to transfer a sale item (e.g. a ticket) is <a href="#tracking-transfer-creation">created</a>
- When a request to transfer a sale item (e.g. a ticket) is <a href="#tracking-transfer-updates">updated</a>

### Sale
- When a sale is <a href="#tracking-sale-creation">created</a>
- When a sale is <a href="#tracking-sale-updates">updated</a>


Beyond updates to principal entities, Inspetor provides additional methods to allow you to inform us about meaningful account activity, such as:

### Login/Logout
- When a user <a href="#tracking-login">logs in to an account</a>
- When a user <a href="#tracking-logout">logs out of an account</a>

### Password
- When a user requests to <a href="#tracking-password-recovery">recover</a> their password
- When a user <a href="#tracking-password-reset">resets</a> their password

## Where to insert Inspetor collection functions
Where in your code base does the Inspetor library belong? Frontend? Backend? Loaded on the site?

Fortunately for you, the answer is quite simple at the moment--we only have one version (PHP) of the Client Library implemented! That means you'll need to integrate our library with your PHP application server.

In the future however, our suggested integration model will be:

- Full event coverage within the server/API level of your application (backend): This allows us to know everything about what is hapening within your product.
- 1:1 corresponding coverage within your frontend interfaces (Desktop, iOS, and Android): This allows us to enrich the knowledge we're gathering from your server-level transactions with additional information that improves our protection capabilities.

You can find additional language-specific implementation details, including suggested architecture and best practices, via the following links:

- [PHP](https://github.com/inspetor/inspetor-php/blob/master/README.md)

## Testing your integration with Inspetor

Integration with Inspetor is meant to be easy--you should be able to simply instantiate our library, call our tracking methods, and if there are no errors thrown within your code execution, the data should appear within our database. However, for further validation, we also provide our customers with limited-access database credentials that allow the developer in charge of integrating Inspetor to see what data appears in our database. (Note that access is restricted such that your customer account will only be able to view data originating from your company's integration.) The Inspetor team will provide you with access credentials for this phase of validation.

However, ensuring that some data is making its way into our database is not sufficient for validating an Inspetor integration. We need to ensure that our understanding of state updates to primary entities (such as sales or accounts) remains accurate over time. This means that after integration, we will need to periodically validate that our representation of sales, accounts, etc. corresponds to the true state of those entities (as represented in the customer database). This phase of validation is highly customer-specific (since it depends on your database implementation), and it will involved coordinated effort from both the customer the Inspetor integration team.

# Collection

The Inspetor Library provides a set of functions that are used to track activities that happen in your application.

**To access all the trackers you will need an instance of the InspetorClient class**, since they are all available there.

All the information that is collected will help our models indentify frauds. Because of that is super important that they are will cofigured.

## Tracking Account Activities

These are the functions that will be used to track the user (*e.g. account*) inside your application. The main activities that will be tracked are the followings:

All the functions for tracking accounts (*e.g. user*) **will receive an [Account](#account) object as argument** and will *return true* if everything goes right. Otherwise they will throw one of the following exceptions:

Exception | Description

# Models

The Inspetor Library provides a set of classes (*e.g. models*) that are used to help you collect the information that we need.

To get new instances of which model we suggest that you use the pre-built "gets" that are available in the InspetorClient class. They are an easy way to have access to every model without having to import every class.

All the models have some optional properties, but it's important that you try to send us as much information as you can. Since this helps our machine learning models make better decisions.
