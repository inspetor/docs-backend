<p>Our data model operates with the assumption that a single event listing could have multiple sessions (for example Lollapalooza may have multiple sessions, but all be considered the same event.) We refer to those sessions as &quot;event datetimes.&quot; Whenever you&#39;re creating an event, or even when you&#39;re selling tickets to an event, you should indicate which event datetime or datetimes should be correlated with that action. </p>

<p>An event datetime requires the following information: </p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The identifier for this event datetime in your platform. Event datetime IDs must be unique per-event (but event datetime ids can be the same if they are sessions of different events)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>datetime</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>The Unix-timestamp corresponding to the date and time of the event datetime</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
