<p>Additionally, there is a <code>/sales/mark_fraudulent</code> endpoint that you should use to update Inspetor when a sale has been rejected or refunded due to suspicion of fraud, or if a sale has resulted in a chargeback.</p>

<p>If a sale is deemed fraudulent (either via your existing antifraud solution, manual analysis, acquirer rejection, or even if you receive a chargeback), it is extremely important that you relay this information to Inspetor. This is perhaps <em>the most valuable piece of information</em> you can send to us; all of our fraud prediction models are trained on this label. </p>

<p>The <code>/sale/mark_fraudulent</code> endpoint supports the <code>POST</code> operation and requires the following arguments:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>When is it required?</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>sale_id</td>
<td><code>POST</code></td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The unique identifier for the sale within your platform</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fraud_signal_type</td>
<td><code>POST</code></td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The mechanism by which you identified the sale as fraudulent. Current accepted values are &#39;acquirer&#39;, other antifraud services such as <strong>&#39;horus&#39;</strong>, <strong>&#39;fraudnet&#39;</strong>, and <strong>&#39;sift&#39;</strong>, your company name (<strong>&#39;ingresse&#39;</strong>), or simply <strong>&#39;chargeback&#39;</strong>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Note: it is expected that when marking a sale fraudulent, one would also make a corresponding call to the <code>/sales</code> endpoint to update a sale with a <code>rejected</code> status (unless the sale was marked fraudulent only after a chargeback was received). </p>
