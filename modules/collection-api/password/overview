<p>Unsurprisingly, there is a correlation between fraudulent activity on an account and password resets or password recovery. As such, Inspetor provides an endpoint where you should notify us of <em>any</em> behavior that involves a user resetting their password or initiating password recovery. You should send information to this endpoint when a user who is not logged in either resets or recovers their password.</p>

<aside class="notice">
This is different than when a logged-in user changes their password. You can notify Inspetor of such changes via the accounts endpoint.

<p>The <code>/forgot-password</code> endpoint accepts <code>POST</code> requests only and requires the following arguments</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Property</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>recovery_email</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The email used to recover or reset the password</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>action</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>The type of user action that was taken. Accepted values are <code>&#39;recovery&#39;</code> and <code>&#39;reset&#39;</code> (case-insensitive)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
